# InterBot
InterBot is a messaging channel for bots to communicate with other bots. Bot-to-bot communication dramatically enhances the capabilities of the bot ecosystem. Developers can create new bots simply by composing them in a particular sequence. Other developers will create utility bots to support bot composition. Bots will provide trust, verification, payments and monetization services to each other. Bot-to-bot communication will enable marketplaces, networks, hierarchies and other advanced configurations. Bots will be able to search and discover other bots and compose new ones. Bots will be able to expand their capabilities and upgrade themselves by using newer component bots. The possibilities are endless - we can't wait to see what the developers come up with.
